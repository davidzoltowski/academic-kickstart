I am a third year PhD student in Neuroscience, advised by Jonathan Pillow and Ryan Adams. My interests are broadly in statistical neuroscience and machine learning, and my current research focuses include latent variable models of neural activity, scalable analysis methods for large-scale neural data, and randomized algorithms. Previously, I received an MPhil in Engineering at the University of Cambridge (advised by Mate Lengyel) and a B.S. in electrical engineering from Michigan State University.
