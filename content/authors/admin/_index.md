I am a postdoc in statistics at Stanford University, where I work with Scott Linderman and David Sussillo on models of neural dynamics and on brain computer interfaces. Before that, I obtained a PhD in Neuroscience at Princeton University. At Princeton I was advised by Jonathan Pillow and worked on a variety of topics in statistical neuroscience in the [Pillow Lab](https://pillowlab.princeton.edu/). I additionally collaborated with Ryan Adams in the [Laboratory for Intelligent Probabilistic Systems](http://lips.cs.princeton.edu/). Previously, I received an MPhil in Engineering at the University of Cambridge as part of the [Computational and Biological Learning Lab](http://learning.eng.cam.ac.uk/Public/) where I was advised by Mate Lengyel, and a B.S. in electrical engineering from Michigan State University.
