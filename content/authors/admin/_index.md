I am a PhD student in Neuroscience at Princeton University where I am advised by and work with Jonathan Pillow in the [Pillow Lab](https://pillowlab.princeton.edu/). I additionally collaborate with Ryan Adams in the [Laboratory for Intelligent Probabilistic Systems](http://lips.cs.princeton.edu/). My interests are in statistical neuroscience and probabilistic machine learning, and my current research projects include latent variable models of neural activity during decision-making, scalable analyses for neural data, and randomized algorithms. Previously, I received an MPhil in Engineering at the University of Cambridge as part of the [Computational and Biological Learning Lab](http://learning.eng.cam.ac.uk/Public/) where I was advised by Mate Lengyel. Before that, I obtained a B.S. in electrical engineering from Michigan State University.
